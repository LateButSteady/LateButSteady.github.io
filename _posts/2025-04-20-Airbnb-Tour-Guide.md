# Airbnb Experience Tour Guide

Hi! I'd love to share one of the most meaningful experiences I had during my sabbatical leave from work.

I had lived in a district close to Hwaseong Fortress in Suwon. After visiting a few times, I began to fall in love with the place. It was peaceful, picturesque, and felt very local — not overly commercialized like many tourist spots in Seoul.

And then I thought:

- *“Wow, this place is perfect for a day trip.”*
- *“It’s got that authentic, down-to-earth Korean vibe that foreign visitors would really appreciate.”*
- *“But... it's not so easy to get here from Seoul without a car.”*
- *“What if I personally pick up travelers, take them on a full-day guided tour, and drop them back in Seoul?”*
- *“I could speak English all day, earn a bit of side income, and even make new friends from around the world!”*

And just like that, I decided to start planning a tour.

I mapped out a route around Hwaseong and the surrounding area — including local markets, restaurants, and scenic spots — and began designing a full-day itinerary.

During this time, I was also exploring the idea of hosting on Airbnb, and that’s when I discovered the **Airbnb Experiences** platform. It turned out to be a perfect match. Here’s what I liked about it:

- No need for upfront capital
- No license required — just be a local with passion
- A decent English speaking skill is required

Thanks to my past experiences with American friends during my KATUSA military service — taking them around Seoul, watching World Cup matches, and sharing Korean food in my home — I felt confident I could do it.

## Tour Program

The tour was based around Suwon’s Hwaseong Fortress and nearby areas. I picked up guests in Seoul in the morning, spent the entire day with them exploring, and dropped them off in the evening. The main itinerary included:

- Exploring a traditional local market
- Introducing the rich history of Hwaseong Fortress
- Walking along the fortress wall
- Trying out Korean traditional archery
- Enjoying a meal at a local Korean restaurant

The tour typically lasted 8 to 10 hours — definitely not a short one! But I loved every moment of it. It gave me the chance to engage with travelers from all over the world and immerse myself in real conversational English. I picked up idioms, expressions, and cultural nuances that no textbook could offer.

After two years of running this program, I could truly feel a sense of freedom and confidence in my English communication. That experience has made my current life in Texas much smoother and more enjoyable.

## Global Friends

The guests who joined my tour came from all walks of life. Over the course of **50+ tours**, I met around **100 people**. Among them were McDonald's crew members, nurses, a high-ranking U.S. Army officer, a forensic engineer, a musical actress, daughters of a cheese farmer, and even a CEO.

We had such a great time exchanging stories about culture, food, and everyday life. I believe they enjoyed not only the unique experience and the warm conversations, but also the beautiful scenery of **Hwaseong Fortress**.

The tour received an impressive **review score of 4.97**, and some of the guests even became friends. I later went hiking  with a guest, and visited supermarket with others to help their shopping — simple moments that turned into special memories.

## Next Plan

Even after dozens of visits, I never got tired of Hwaseong Fortress. To this day, I still miss walking there. I think this deep attachment comes from the time I spent as a tour guide. The whole experience gave me confidence and taught me how to be a respectful, yet lighthearted friend — even to people I had just met.

After moving to Dallas, Texas, I’ve started dreaming of launching a similar tour program here. Someday, I hope to get a pickup truck, take guests out to the countryside, and host outdoor cooking parties around a campfire. I’d love to include my family in the experience too.

I believe it’ll be a really exciting new chapter in my life — just like my time as an Airbnb tour guide in Korea.
