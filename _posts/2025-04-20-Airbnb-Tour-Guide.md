Hi, this is one of what I did during my sabbatical leave.

I opened and ran a guide tour program for foreign travelers in Airbnb platform and ran it for 2 years. Here is the main page of my tour program.

I took charge of one full day of my guests from picking up, hanging out, and driving back to Seoul. A broad spectrum of guests reached my program. There was a McDonald's crew, nurses, an US Army high rank officer, a forensic engineer, daughters of cheese farmer, and even a CEO. Everyone had a lot of fun talking with me about culture, food, and life. Of course they liked the beautiful view of **Hwaseong fortress** area, Korean archery experience and local food. I had about **100 guests for 65 days, review-scored of 4.97**

What's more, I thoroughly enjoyed the program. Since the tour was 8 to 10 hours long, it gave me a fantastic opportunity for free international English speaking practice, and I also made a lot of global friends.

After participating in this program for two years, I felt a real sense of freedom in my English conversations. It surely helps my current life in Texas.

Since moving to Dallas, Texas, I've been dreaming about launching another tour program. I'm thinking of getting a pickup truck so I can take my guests for a drive and then have a cooking party with a campfire in a nice, quiet wood. It's going to be a really exciting chapter in my life.
